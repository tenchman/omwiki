* better support for background/text colors
** (#XXXXXX) for background colors
** {#XXXXXX} for text colors
* support for combined text/background colors
** i.e. {#XXXXXX;#XXXXXX} and simply {} for reset to former colors
* support syntax highlighted code fragment via exterbal formatters
** i.e. {{code class="c"}}...{{code}}
* reduce code size while adding new features (boah!)
* rework contenttype detection
